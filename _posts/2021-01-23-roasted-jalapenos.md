total_time: 25M
preparations:
- Toss whole jalapenos in a bowl with a light drizzle of olive oil.
instructions:
- Layer jalapenos on a cooking tray, preferably on a rack sitting in a cooking tray, helping promote circulation around the entire pepper.
- Place under a broiler and roast for about 12-15 minutes, flipping halfway through.  The peppers should begin to darken and char around the skin.
- Remove from oven and place roasted jalapenos into a plastic bag and wrap with a towel for about five minutes.  This will help let moisture get in between the outer fiberous skin and that big fleshy skin, helping ease the peeling process.
- Once the peppers are cool enough to handle, begin separating the majority of the flakey skin from meaty skin. (You may require gloves for this process, and try not to touch your face until thoroughly washing your hands.)
- They are now ready to be used in your dish.
