## Cooking Instructions

- Remove bacon, strain from bacon fat, and pat dry with a paper towel.

- Add one part chopped bacon to two parts salt in a blender and blend until melded together.  Dealers choice.

- Store in container and use as needed.  The salt should help preserve the bacon salt for at least a month.
