introduction: "Once you try dry salt brining your steaks, you may never want to prepare it any other way.  When we talk about dry brining a steak, we are basically talking about curing it.  Salt helps penetrate the meat over time. The moisture of the meat breaks down the water-soluble elements in the seasoning creating a glaze which eventually seeps back into the meat. The process also breaks down the muscle proteins in the beef, rendering it more tender."

## Preperation

- Remove the steaks from the packaging and place onto a large preperation area.

- Graciously coat the entire steak in the salt rub.  Don't forget to include those meaty sides.

- Place uncovered steaks on the grated rack and into the refrigerator so that air can circulate around the steak as it cures.  This should help promote a nicely piece of steak infused with salty deliciousness.

- Let sit for no less than 10 minutes to 1 hour; atleast 24 hours is preferred though, but no more than 4 days.  Adjust the amount of salt initially used according to the brine time.

- Remove from refriderator about 10 minutes before you want to cook it.  Give it a quick once over with a paper towel, patting it dry.

- It is now ready to be cooked.
