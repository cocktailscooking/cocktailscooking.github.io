introduction: "Clarified Butter, aka Ghee, is a staple for a high smoke point butter.  By separting the butter fat from the water and milk fat over a low heat, we can render out the golden nector.  In this recipe, we're going to elevate the clarified butter with whole garlic cloves.  The outcome, will deliver delicious high smoke point substitute with a hint of garlic."

instructions:
- Melt the butter and whole garlic cloves over low heat, trying to maintain a soft simmer. We want the butter to melt slowly, inviting in the garlic flavor as it warms.  If the butter roils in a boil, the milk solids get dispersed throughout, making it more difficult skim them off.  Be sure to occasionally swirl the pot in a soft circular motion.
- Use the slotted spoon to skim off the foamy milk solids that rise to the top.  Place it into a small bowl and save it.  This skimmed milk fat is excellent for helping create "browned butter".
- By the time the milk fat stops rising to the top and has been removed, the garlic should be cooked through with a smooth soft texture.  They may have a bit of caramelization, bonus flavor for later use.
- Remove sauce pot from heat and remove the cloves of garlic into a separate bowl.  While this recipe is done with this garlic, they can reused by mashing it into a paste and folding it into a soft butter, great for a garlic spread.
- Carefully ladle the golden nector from the pot and into a jar where it will be stored.  Be cautious not to ladle the water or browned bits that may have settled in the bottom.
- Left at room temperature, the liquid will solidify and can be safely stored in the pantry in an airtight jar for several months. Alternatively, you can keep it in the fridge for up to one year.
