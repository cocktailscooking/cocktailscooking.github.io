cuisine: Steak
prep_time: 60M
cook_time: 10M
total_time: 70M
instructions:
- Ensure the steak is seasoned and ready for cooking.  At the minimum, pat dry, salt/pepper, let set for 10 minutes but we recommend at least an hour.
- Preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 tbsp oil helps reduces splatter.
- Evenly sprinkle a bit of salt on the bottom of the pan and add steaks to be seared for about 3-4 minutes per side.
- While searing, add butter and aromatics – melt in butter with crushed garlic cloves and some rosemary sprigs.
- Gracefully spoon copeous amounts of the liquid butter all over the steaks.  Tilt the pan so that the butter can pool to one side, making it easier to spoon over the steaks.  Do this often until they reach the desired doneness.  They should be encased in a nice delicious crust. 3-4 minutes per side. 1 minute per edge
- Remove steaks from heat and rest 5-10 minutes.  Be careful not to cut them before they have fully rested.
- When slicing, be sure it's against the grain.

### Food Safety

A steaks internal temperature continues to rise as it rests, so remove steaks from the pan about 5-10 degrees before reaching your desired doneness. Use this chart to determine steak doneness when testing with an instant-read thermometer. For example, if you desire a medium doneness steak, remove it from the pan at 120 degrees F and it should rise to 125-130˚F as it rests. Use the following steak temperature chart. These numbers reflect the temperature before resting 10 minutes.

- 120°F = Rare
- 125°F = Medium Rare
- 130°F = Medium
- 140°F = Medium Well
- 150°F = Well Done
