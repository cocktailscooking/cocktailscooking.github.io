Once you try dry salt brining your steaks, you may never want to prepare it any other way.  When we talk about dry brining a steak, we are basically talking about curing it.  Salt and other seasonings are used which penetrate the meat over time. The moisture of the meat breaks down the water-soluble elements in the seasoning creating a glaze which eventually seeps back into the meat. The process also breaks down the muscle proteins in the beef, rendering it more tender.

## Ingredients

### For Dry Salt Brining

- Steak
  - At least 1.5 inches thick
- Sea Salt Rocks or Flakes
  - [Bacon Sea Salt Rub](/bacon-sea-salt-rub)
  - [Coffee and Cocoa Sea Salt Rub](/coffee-cocoa-sea-salt-rub)
  - [Liquid Smoked Sea Salt Rub](/liquid-smoked-sea-salt-rub)
- Cold Storage with minimal strong odors

### For Pan Seared Cooking

- High Temperature Cooking Oil
- Unsalted Butter
- Crushed Garlic
- Fresh Rosemary Sprigs
- 10 - 12 inch skillet

## Cooking Instructions

### Preperation

- Graciously coat your entire steak in your chosen Sea Salt Rub.  Make sure to get the sides.

- Place steaks on a rack so that air can circulate around the steak.

- Place rack with salt rubbed steaks, uncovered, into the fridge for no less than 24 hours and no more than 4 days.

### Pan-Sear Steak

- Pull steaks out of the fridge and let rest, coming to room temperature, for at least one hour before cooking.

- Preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 tbsp oil reduces splatter.

- Add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).

- Add butter and aromatics – melt in butter with crushed garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness.

- Remove steak and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.

## Food Safety

A steaks internal temperature continues to rise as it rests, so remove steaks from the pan about 5-10 degrees before reaching your desired doneness. Use this chart to determine steak doneness when testing with an instant-read thermometer. For example, if you desire a medium doneness steak, remove it from the pan at 120 degrees F and it should rise to 125-130˚F as it rests. Use the following steak temperature chart. These numbers reflect the temperature before resting 10 minutes.

- 120°F = Rare
- 125°F = Medium Rare
- 130°F = Medium
- 140°F = Medium Well
- 150°F = Well Done
