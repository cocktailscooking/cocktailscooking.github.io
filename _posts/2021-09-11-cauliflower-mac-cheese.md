total_time: 85M
preparations:
- Cut away the stem from the cauliflower and chop the florets into 1/2 inch to 1 inch pieces.
- Mince shallot, garlic, jalapenos, and chives.
- Preheat the oven to 400ÂºF.
instructions:
- Fill large saucepan with 1 inch of water, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, and bring to a boil. Add the cauliflower and cook until tender, 6 to 7 minutes. Drain and set aside in a large bowl.
- Using the same large saucepan, add oil and butter over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the minced shallots and cook about 2 minutes.  Once the shallots become translucent, add the minced jalapenos and cook about 2 more minutes, finally, add the minced garlic and cook for another 2 minutes.
- Stir in flour. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring continually 3 - 4 minutes, to cook out the flour.  The texture should be a bit like a paste.
- Add the red pepper flakes and slowly incorporate the milk while whisking, slowly raising the heat to medium-high until it comes to a simmer and becomes smooth and thick texture, about 2 minutes stirring; season with 1/2 teaspoon salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes.
- Once it becomes thick, remove from heat completely onto another burner if possible. Add the cheddar cheese, 1/4 cup at a time mixing well until cheese is all melted. Repeat with the parmesan.
- Stir in cooked cauliflower, then pour into a baking dish and bake until bubbly and golden, about 15 to 20 minutes. Then broil 2 minutes, or until the top is slightly browned.
- Remove from oven and let stand for about five minutes before serving.
