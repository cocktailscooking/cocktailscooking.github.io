introduction: "My mom introduced me to the concept of a Salad Roll.  I was blown away at the ingenuity in the creation of such a unique take on a Chicken Salad.  I found it to be quite handy to have on standby in the fridge too.  It also keeps very well."
cuisine: Salad
prep_time: 15M
cook_time: 10M
total_time: 30M
preparations:
- Trim the bottom from the Romaine Lettuce.  Pair all leaves based on similar width and length.  We want the longer, wider pieces, with the wider pieces to be used on the outer most layer of our roll.
- Core and dice the apple.
- Remove bones from the meat of the roasted chicken.
- Cut the butchers twine into 7 strips of 12 inches each.
instructions:
- In a mixing bowl, fold the chicken, diced apple, a half cup mayonaise, a quarter cup brown mustard, and a tsp of red pepper flakes into an even consistency.  Add salt and pepper to taste.
- Set aside the four largest leaves, these will be our outter most layer.
- Starting with one leaf of the smaller leaf pairs, spoon the chicken mix along the spine of the leaf.  Similar to how you would lay peanut butter on celary.
- Place a strip of bacon along the length of the chicken mix on the lettuce; place its paired leaf on top, reversed tip to tail.  It should now look like a lettuce cocoon of goodness.
- Repeat the process until the only lettuce remaining are the ones set aside.
- With the parchment paper flat, lay two large leaves side by side.
- Begin stacking the cocoons of chicken lettuce with the larger pairs towards the outside and the smaller ones towards the middle.  This part is a bit tricky so take your time and try to keep the pieces together.
- With all of the pieces in place, using the large leafs on the bottom, pull together like a taco, using the other two remaining leaves to complete the glorious salad roll.  I come from under the parchment paper, it makes it a bit easier to manipulate into the cylinder shape.
- With the lettuce roll now complete, reach one end of the parchment paper over to the top of the roll and tuck it tightly under the roll.  Roll the Chicken Salad Roll firmly within the parchment paper and twist the side of the paper to seal it.
- Starting in the middle and working outwards to the ends, tie the pieces of butchers twine equidistance apart.
- Place the roll into the fridge and let sit for about 30 or 40 minutes.
- To serve, cut the roll in the middle, between the strips of butchers twine and place on the plate.
