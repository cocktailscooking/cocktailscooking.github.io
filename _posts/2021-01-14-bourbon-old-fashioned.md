## Mixing Instructions

- Pour 2oz of Bourbon into the Cocktail Mixing Glass and add 4-5 drops of the bitters.

- Add a dab of Simple Syrup and stir.

- Use the cocktail peeler to peel a neat strip from the orange while holding it over the glass.  As it peels, the oils should express themselves onto the interior of the glass; adding a delicate citrus flavor.

- Place the large ice cube into the glass and pour Bourbon mix from the mixing glass over the ice. Give the cocktail a stir to chill Bourbon mixture.

- Twirl peeled orange strip and place on top of the ice cube.

- Top with luxardo cherry and serve.
