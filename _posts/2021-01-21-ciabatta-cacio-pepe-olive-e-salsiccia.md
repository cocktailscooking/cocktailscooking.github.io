instructions:
- Preheat oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit and place pizza stone or baking tray inside to warm.
- Heat frying pan to medium-high with a small bit of clarified butter.
- Add sliced garlic and sliced cherry peppers; gently sauteeing until lightly charred.  Remove from heat.
- With the ciabatta laying flat, equally halve the bread by cutting parallel to the cutting board.  This will render two equal pizza surfaces.
- Generously coat the softer side of the bread with clarified butter, the more that gets used, the more the bread can absorb as it cooks.  We used our homemade Clarifed Garlic Butter.
- Sprinkle red pepper flakes and coarsely ground pepper next.  We want the clarified butter to slightly cook those peppers, helping release the flavors into pizza.
- Lightly sprinkle a layer of parmigiano-reggiano and then the chopped mixed olives.
- Add a layer of chopped salami and then the sauteed garlic and cherry peppers.  Sprinkle with another light layer of parmigiano-reggiano.
- Place on pizza stone and bake for 15 minutes.
- Remove from pizza stone when desired doneness is achieved and let sit for roughly three minutes.  This will let the ingredients set, helping ease the cutting process.
- Enjoy!
