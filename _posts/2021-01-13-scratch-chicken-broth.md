The best flavors of a chicken come from the pieces most people prefer to toss.  Rather than toss out the bones, fat, and other waste, I recommend brewing your own chicken stock.  This is perfect to put together as you prepare your primary meal.

## Ingredients

- Leftover bones and skin from a large cooked or rotisserie chickens
- Rosemary Sprigs
- Celery tops and celery ribs, cut into 2-inch strips
- Onion quartered
- Carrot quartered, cut into 2-inch strips
- Crushed Garlic
- Sliced Ginger
- Salt
- Pepper
- Water

## Cooking Instructions

- Heat stock pot on medium heat.  Add butter and melt.  As it melts, add crushed garlic and rosemary sprigs to melting butter.  Saute until garlic has a buttery texture, maybe five minutes.  Add ginger slices about half way through sauting the garlic butter.

- Put the leftover bones and skin from a chicken carcass into the large stock pot with garlic and rosemary butter. Add vegetables, celery, onion, carrots.  Cover with hot water, just barely covering the highest ingredient.  Add salt and pepper, about 1 tsp of salt, 1/4 tsp of pepper.

- Bring to a boil and immediately reduce heat to bring the stock to barely a simmer.  Simmer partially covered at least 4 hours, occasionally skimming off any foam that comes to the surface.  (I like to simmer the stock overnight for maximum flavor concentration)

- Remove the bones and vegetables with a slotted spoon or spider ladle, and strain the stock through a fine mesh sieve.

- Rapidly cool the stock, move into storage containers, and place into the fridge.

## Food Safety

> Leaving food out too long at room temperature can cause bacteria to grow to dangerous levels that can cause illness. Bacteria grow most rapidly in the range of temperatures between 40 °F and 140 °F, doubling in number in as little as 20 minutes. This range of temperatures is often called the "Danger Zone."
