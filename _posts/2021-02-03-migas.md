cuisine: tex-mex

total_time: 30M
preparations:
- Cut tortillas, onion, and bell pepper into quarter inch strips and set aside.
- Peel garlic and slightly crush to release the core juices.
- Dice jalapeno and cilantro
- Chop bacon into smaller sizes
instructions:
- In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, ground cumin, and a dash of salt.  Mix in tortilla strips about 5-10 minutes before putting it on the stove, keeping them in for longer will produce a softer/mushier mixture.
- Heat oil over medium heat in a large skillet.  Add Chopped Bacon and cook until most fat is rendered out.  Remove bacon from skillet and place on a paper towel in a bowl to soak the bacon grease.
- Add tortillas to egg mixture if this hasn't been done yet.
- Return skillet to stove with medium-high heat.  Add onion and saute for about 5 minutes or until they begin to look translucent.  Then add diced jalapenos and the crushed garlic.  Saute for another 5 minutes.  Flipping the ingredients often.
- Reduce heat to medium and add the bell pepper and 2 tbsp of butter, slightly sauteeing them for about 2 minutes.  We want to retain the crunch of the pepper.
- Add the egg mixture and cook for about 5-7 minutes, stirring frequently.  We want the eggs to be completely scrambled.
- Top with a light layer of cheese, a lovely dose of diced cilantro, and season with kosher salt and coarse pepper.  Remove from heat and let stand for 1-2 minutes before serving.
- Serve warm, garnished with desired toppings.
