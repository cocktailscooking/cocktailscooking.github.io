introduction: "The best flavors of a chicken come from the pieces most people prefer to toss.  Rather than discard the bones, fat, and other perceived waste, I recommend preparing a chicken stock from scratch.  This is perfect to put together as you prepare a different meal since you can toss all of the odd bits from those ingrediants, into your chicken broth stock pot."

## Cooking Instructions

- Add butter and whole garlic cloves to sauce pot and set to low-medium heat

- Remove garlic from the butter and mash garlic until it reaches a thick pastey texture.

- Add garlic paste to the butter and mix until ingredients are fully incorporated.
